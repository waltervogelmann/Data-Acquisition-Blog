# Data-Acquisition-Blog

**My research question:** How do at-bat outcomes differ when pitchers throw a strike versus a ball on the first pitch, controlling for batter aggression?

This repository contains my process of collecting and analyzing MLB data to answer the above research question. I utilized the `pybaseball` library to gather pitch-level data for the 2024 MLB season, focusing on first-pitch outcomes and their impact on at-bat results.

The files in this repository include:
- `mlb_first_pitch_data_collection_and_eda.py` - Full data collection script & Exploratory data analysis
- `mlb_first_pitch_data_2024.csv` - The complete dataset (if under GitHub's size limit)
- Visualization images generated from the analysis
